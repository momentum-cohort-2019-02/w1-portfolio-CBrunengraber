        <p style="text-indent: 40px"> For those who have met me, they know I am passionate about building and details. 
          I can remodel your home, evaluate the quality of your finances from your retirement account through your diamond jewelry, or streamline your business with clear and concise processes. I have helped clients solve varied problems, ranging from cash loans as little as $10 to the business owner needing a $1,000,000 real estate title loan. Every client has a unique issue, and I use years of problem solving experience from multiple fields to solve them.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px">In my spare time, you can find me partaking in one of my many hobbies, including (but
          not limited to) kayaking, fishing, hockey, playing guitar, aquarium keeper, antiquing, collecting weird
          stuff, renovating my home, and restoring old things. I am passionate about “reduce, reuse, recycle,” and excitable
          when my work and hobbies coincide with that motto. Most importantly, I am a husband of thirteen years to my
          wonderful wife Jessica, and father to my two young children.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third">
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">I have an insatiable appetite for learning new things, and I am excited about the
          future of programming. Launching my new career as a python developer is my top priority.
