        <p style="text-indent: 40px">Craig Brunengraber is a new student at the Momentum immersive coding course for
          Python
          programming. I am passionate about building and details. I can remodel your home, evaluate the quality of
          your finances from your retirement account through your diamond jewelry, or streamline your business with
          clear
          and concise processes. I have helped clients solve problems from the person needing $10 to get bus fare
          through $1,000,000 real estate title loans. Every client has a unique issue, and I use years of problem
          solving experience from multiple fields to solve them.</p>

      <div class="second">
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">In my spare time, you can find me doing one of my many hobbies, including (but
          not limited to) kayaking, fishing, hockey, playing guitar, aquarium keeper, antiquing, collecting weird
          stuff,
          fixing his home, and restoring old things. I am passionate about “reduce, reuse, recycle,” and am excited
          when my work and hobbies coincide with that motto. Most importantly, I am a husband of thirteen years to my
          wonderful wife Jessica, and father to my two young children.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="third">
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">I have an insatiable appetite for learning new things, and am excited about the
          future of programming. I am looking forward to my new career as a python developer.
